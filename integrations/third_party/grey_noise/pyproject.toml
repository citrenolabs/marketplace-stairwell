name = "GreyNoiseIntegration"
version = "6.0"
description = "GreyNoise tells security analysts what not to worry about. We do this by curating data on IPs that saturate security tools with noise. This unique perspective helps analysts confidently ignore irrelevant or harmless activity, creating more time to uncover and investigate true threats. Includes Actions to allow IP enrichments and GNQL queries via the GreyNoise API.  This integration supports access to both the Paid and Community APIs.  Users with Community API Access will only have access to the Community IP Lookup Action.  For more details, visit https://greynoise.io"
